# Dough

Dough is a project being undertaken by Harsh Pendse and Mukul Ram. It is a preliminary project aimed at setting up a single website and product from scratch.

The fundamental idea behind Dough is a humourous one - it involves the notion that people go to college events only for the free food, and there isn't any service that directly exploits this phenomenon.

However, beyond the cartoonish nature of the concept, this project is aimed at improving our skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, PHP, mySQL, UI/UX, Adobe Suite, and web design fundamentals.
